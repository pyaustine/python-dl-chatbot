        "Did you know that HIV came from chimps as far back as the 19th century? Human hunters were the bridge to this, as they would eat the meat or come into contact with the blood of monkeys and apes. HIV, fully known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a virus that weakens the body’s ability to fight off infections. A non-curable but controllable disease. Therefore a person infected with HIV has a resultant weak immunity and if not treated will lead to AIDS- Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome- the most severe phase of HIV infection."
